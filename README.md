# StrategyPattern
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The client code (or context) can choose the strategy (algorithm) to execute at runtime, and the same interface is used for all strategies.
